# CS-Stuff
This is a repository of some CS problems/puzzles that I've been working on to build up my CS skills (practice using algorithms and data structures, etc.). I started doing many of these on leetcode.com, but took them in to Visual Studio when I needed to do some extra debugging that was too difficult using the leetcode interface.

Many of the algorithms in this repo are implemented as projects inside a Visual Studio solution. They create Windows console applications that print test input and output.
